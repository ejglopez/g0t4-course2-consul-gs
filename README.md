# Getting Started with Consul - 2nd Edition



## 1st Edition - Notes

In 2016, I published two courses about Consul:
- [Getting Started with Consul](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/consul-getting-started)
- [Deploying Consul](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/consul-deploying)

Original examples are available via github: [Consul Getting Started](https://github.com/g0t4/consul-getting-started).
- FYI, 2nd Edition examples compliment the 1st Edition examples so you can continue to learn from, and test drive, the 1st Edition examples with current versions of Consul.
