# Getting Started with Consul - 2nd Edition

## 1st Edition - Notes

- In 2016, I published two courses about Consul:
  - [Getting Started with Consul](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/consul-getting-started)
  - [Deploying Consul](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/consul-deploying)
- Examples (for both courses) are available via github: [Consul Getting Started](https://github.com/g0t4/consul-getting-started).
  - 2nd Edition examples are new/modernized to compliment the 1st Edition examples.
- At this time I am only updating the 1st Edition `Getting Started` course.
  - That said, some updated materials may overlap with the `Deploying` course.
