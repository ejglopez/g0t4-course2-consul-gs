# Service Examples

Consul is language agnostic. Use whatever language/platform best suits your needs. And existing apps will all work as well. To demonstrate this I have a series of three services written in different languages:

- `orders`: `javascript` / [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/), [`hapi`](https://hapi.dev/) web framework
- `shipments`: `C#` / [`.NET`](https://dot.net/)
- `tracking`: [`go`](https://go.dev/)
